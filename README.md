#WDI Project 3
Sugar-Rush is a dessert delivery application targeted towards young adults and late-night snackers. This business currently operates from 7pm to 3am everyday in three neighborhoods: Silverlake, Santa Monica, and North Hollywood. Can't decide between two restaurants? Don't worry, we got you! Sugar-Rush keeps an inventory of the most popular offerings of the hottest dessert joints in the greater Los Angeles area. Worried about security? Chill out! S-R uses venmo-authentication so all your personal info is safe and secure. Not hungry? ... switch to a different tab and come back in a couple hours.

Sugar-Rush is a group project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. The assignment was to create a web application with an express framework that has crudable models, an API, and external authentication. In addition to having fulfilled the project requirements, Sugar Rush allows users to login/register, search through our restaurant database, and order items of varying quantities. Admins have access to both API databases and can create, edit, destroy restaurants and orders.

In future versions, Sugar-Rush will have driver profiles and will link orders to the drivers that will deliver them. It will also let users pay for orders through their linked venmo accounts. In addition, we plan to add geolocation and mobile support.
